# Advanced Matrix Operations and Orthogonalization Techniques

## Overview

This assignment delves into essential matrix operations and orthogonalization methods, specifically focusing on the implementation of four key techniques:

1. **Hadamard Product**: Element-wise multiplication of matrices.
2. **Kronecker Product**: A generalized matrix product used in various applications.
3. **Khatri-Rao Product**: A column-wise Kronecker product, particularly useful in multi-linear algebra.
4. **Gram-Schmidt Process**: An orthogonalization method that transforms a set of vectors into an orthogonal set.

The project is structured into several scripts and data files to facilitate these matrix operations and the orthogonalization process.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:

- **Data Directory**:
  - `mat1.txt`: A sample matrix file for matrix operations.
  - `mat2.txt`: Another sample matrix file.
  - `V1.txt`: Matrix file used in the Gram-Schmidt process (example 1).
  - `V2.txt`: Matrix file used in the Gram-Schmidt process (example 2).

- **Scripts**:
  - **`GramSchmidt.py`**: Implements the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process.
  - **`Kronecker_KhatriRao_Hadamard.py`**: Handles the implementation of the Hadamard, Kronecker, and Khatri-Rao products.
  - **`Random_Matrix_Generator.py`**: Generates random matrices with user-specified dimensions and value ranges.

## How to Use

### 1. **Kronecker_KhatriRao_Hadamard.py**

This script enables users to perform three distinct matrix operations:

- **Hadamard Product**: Computes the element-wise product of two matrices.
- **Kronecker Product**: Computes the Kronecker product of two matrices, which is a more complex form of matrix multiplication.
- **Khatri-Rao Product**: Computes the Khatri-Rao product, which is a column-wise Kronecker product useful in tensor operations.

**Running the Script**:
1. Execute `Kronecker_KhatriRao_Hadamard.py`.
2. Select an operation from the menu:
   - Enter `1` for the Hadamard Product.
   - Enter `2` for the Kronecker Product.
   - Enter `3` for the Khatri-Rao Product.
3. Load two matrices from text files when prompted.
4. View the results of the selected operation.

### 2. **GramSchmidt.py**

This script applies the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize a set of vectors:

**Running the Script**:
1. Execute `GramSchmidt.py`.
2. Select the Gram-Schmidt Process from the menu.
3. Load a matrix where each column represents a vector to be orthogonalized.
4. View the orthogonalized vectors as the output.

### 3. **Random_Matrix_Generator.py**

This script generates random matrices based on user-defined dimensions and value ranges:

**Running the Script**:
1. Execute `Random_Matrix_Generator.py`.
2. Provide the range of values for the matrix (e.g., `1,10`).
3. Provide the dimensions of the matrix (e.g., `3,4`).
4. The script will generate and display a random matrix based on the inputs provided.

## Example Usage

### Generating a Random Matrix

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Random_Matrix_Generator.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to input the range of values and dimensions.

### Performing a Matrix Operation

1. Run the script for the desired operation:
   ```bash
   python Kronecker_KhatriRao_Hadamard.py
   ```
2. Choose the desired operation and input the file paths for the matrices.

### Performing Gram-Schmidt Process

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python GramSchmidt.py
   ```
2. Load the vector space matrix and view the orthogonalized vectors.

## Notes

- Ensure that matrix files (`mat1.txt`, `mat2.txt`, `V1.txt`, `V2.txt`) are correctly formatted and located in the `Data` directory.
- The code assumes that matrices and vectors are provided in text files with integer values separated by spaces.

## Conclusion

This assignment showcases critical matrix operations and the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process, foundational in various mathematical and computational applications. The provided scripts allow you to explore these operations and understand their relevance in optimization theory and beyond.

Feel free to modify or extend the scripts to experiment further or add additional functionality.
